# Use recurrent neural networks to build a transliteration system

Using Recurrent Neural Networks, we build a poject here, which implements a sequence to sequence learning, Wen have also done comparing different cells such as vanilla RNN, LSTM and GRU and understanding how attention networks overcome the limitations of vanilla seq2seq models and have visualised the interactions between different components in a RNN based model.
