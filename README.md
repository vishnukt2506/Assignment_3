This repository contains the codes and reports for the assignment 3 of the course CS6910 - Fundamentals of Deep Learning, conducted by Prof Mitesh Khapra at IIT Madras

# Use recurrent neural networks to build a transliteration system

Using Recurrent Neural Networks, we build a poject here, which implements a sequence to sequence learning, Wen have also done comparing different cells such as vanilla RNN, LSTM and GRU and understanding how attention networks overcome the limitations of vanilla seq2seq models and have visualised the interactions between different components in a RNN based model. 

# The use of wandb

We have used the wandb for hyperparameter configuration, It can also be used to generate automatic plots and the same can be cloned to our wandb reports. It was helpful in visualizing the training, organizing and comparing lots of training runs and can also be used to analyze our models.
